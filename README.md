 ## Working of the code:

1. **Game Description:**
   - The code implements a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the user competes against the computer.

2. **Winner Determination:**
   - The `determine_winner` function compares the user's choice with the computer's choice to determine the winner of each round.

3. **Scoring System:**
   - The game keeps track of the user and computer scores throughout multiple rounds.

4. **User Input:**
   - The user is prompted to input their choice: rock, paper, or scissors.

5. **Input Validation:**
   - The program checks for invalid choices and prompts the user to choose again if the input is not one of the valid options.

6. **Random Computer Choice:**
   - The computer's choice is randomly generated using the `random` module.

7. **Result Display:**
   - The user's and computer's choices, as well as the result of the round, are displayed to the user.

8. **Score Update:**
   - The scores are updated based on the outcome of each round, and the current scores are shown to the user.

9. **Game Loop:**
   - The game continues in a loop until the user decides not to play again.

10. **Game Termination:**
    - The user is asked if they want to play again, and the game continues until the user decides to exit. The final scores are displayed upon exit.
